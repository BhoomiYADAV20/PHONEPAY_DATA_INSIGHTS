This project analyzes PhonePe Pulse data to explore digital payment trends across Indian states and districts from 2018 to 2023. Using Python, the raw JSON data was transformed into CSVs, followed by exploratory data analysis and insight generation. The final output is an interactive Streamlit dashboard that visualizes transaction amounts, top regions, and mobile device usage by year and quarter.
